# notes

> "I think what is neat about art is it can program-ize the extrapolation process of feeling,... What is neat about this is once we admit to the reality of another internal process, everything has meaning" (pg. 4)

internal processes are guided by ones particular tapestry of signs and symbolic meanings. in the context of art, or what is (in Gabi's view) the externalizing of an internal process, taking the internal process of another as their inner world of signs symbols hence meaningmaking, all works of art however mundane have value, all things are worth studying, infinite lores to embed yourself in.

> "But isnt that in itself fun? That this aesthetic executive function (to *choose* the degree to which you sense things) is the barrier between us and pure input?" (pg 5)

> "the degree to which others are able to limit themselves unknowingly in order ot accommodate their realities has mean to me that i have the liberty to negotiate mine actively, though it is a lot of work" (pg 6)

correctly identifying the agency to *choose* how exactly it is that you interface with stimuli in the external world, i.e. tailoring your world-sense. Inner world building, to live becomes to play. 

> "There are so many processes and experience that have no useful place in the world. For example, here is one process that exists in me. It's worked this way for as long as i can remember it. it involves extreme, deep entrenchment in one idea or concept, never exactly making peace with the idea as it exists in the world outside of me, accompanied by absolute rejection of everything else, until something happens, the flower wilts, and i move on, persistent only in my totalizing rejection, except with this new thing." (pg. 13)

Single minded interest in things as long as your mind allows it? Again opting for subjective readings of *things* as opposed to common conceptions or associated reactionary conventions--in short, obsession. Notes that such kinds of obsession in things is perceived as "odd", but, in Gabi's words:

> "The alternative to having such attributes on my person in in my life is not worth it. Such things are fun, and they allow me to see with my own eyes instead of with the eyes of a mediated social middleman."

Importantly: 

> "I can approach the world without the sort of resentment that a person has when they are required to change an integral part of themselves. To me having clarity is more important than having cohesion"

There's a valuing of the onanistic worth of one's engagement with external stimuli, regardless of the interpersonal difficulties such a ethos derives. What is a fundamental exploration of a thing despite its (apparently) unambiguous nature (in general consciousness), in essence, to regard all things as a putty to kneed in the hands and gawk at in wonder of it's peculiar properties, stimming. The power of this is living in a world of your own design, one that is of the utmost comfort at any given moment. To live in the comfort of a symbolic world entirely of your own design. (Critique: Requires a certain prenatal endowment of lust for life and sensibility, and, above all, the ability to translate sensibility into observable material. No one wants to live in the shit of their own half ideas.)

In regards to the spontaneity of production, art as sincere products of a cherished lived experience:

> "When a structure is suggested, allow the structure to attempt to build itself. If it does not, it knows it cannot. It is about trust and respect. If it can, however, you get to see something new. That itself is to be cherished. Let itself build its own house. (18)

Ultimately, to walk up and down the paveways of your life is to be pushed and pulled around by certain preoccupations. When you roam this luscious pasture you will inevitably stumble over hotspots of fervent kinetic energy which demands activity--landmines of interest and a resultant production. These should not be contrived, they are a natural biproduct of ones own agency and will to form personal ties to the earth and its fruits. When they come it is a miracle. When they are still-born it is equally a miracle, yet one not yet ready for manifestation, or perhaps without place in the personal symbolic world at all.

>"Despite the very thing I am preoccupied with being the pleasure of felling without the baggage of assumption of co-occurring other feelings, I often have become absolutely riddled with the  in the door by the probability that I am misunderstood. This becomes its own anxiety, one which completely contradicts the purpose of the first. Because the pleasure I take in actions involves a volume so great this it is completely not worth describing to another and often stays before language merely to be the pleasure of the assemblage I have gathered together and held with me over the course of my lifetime and which necessarily no one can fully share, except in the language of assembly." (19)

Isolation. Becoming lost in the wilderness of your inner world.

>"I have a theoretical concept that has been with me since i was a teenager. I call it "fuck everyone in the house." I got it from pornography. The concept is meant to illustrate multiple deep empathy. If a person is to be understood, they are to be understood completely."


a trestise on sincerity to yourself in the face of so many external forces which insist you assimilate and water down the quintessence of yourself (perhaps for love, fame, praise, etc). narrates a specific dialogue i held with myself for multiple years from the ages of 16 to 21. In the face of repeated failures to draw anyone close to me and to share in my inner world, would i be better off casting away continents of this world to be lost under oceans, in order to have a greater compatibility with others? The result would be somewhat dissapointing to gabi I fear. I capitulated in many ways, with varying success on very shaky, precarious legs (i am very much still a newborn lamb in regards to drawing the company of others). yet in many ways I can relate almost exactly to, not a particular experience described, but the knowledge of the possibility of this exact state, a relative nearness to it, and ultimately an ambition to it. there was a period where i felt an extreme sincerity in regards to myself and my expression of self and my capacity to draw near to myself and what I saw as most important. These were derived out of an earnest relationship with beauty composed and manifested by others in the forms of, principally, music and film. There was a coherent mental concept of what I did and did not enjoy. A sensibility which was tangible to me. one which brought me value in the form of preoccupational rumination.  Gabi descibes a single minded objective of grasping a concept in the mind with a steadfast grip, decoding a thing in the ciphers of a mind defined by
