# notes

"I think what is neat about art is it can program-ize the extrapolation process of feeling,... What is neat about this is once we admit to the reality of another internal process, everything has meaning" (pg. 4)

internal processes are guided by ones particular tapestry of signs and symbolic meanings. in the context of art, or what is (in Gabi's view) the externalizing of an internal process, taking the internal process of another as their inner world of signs symbols hence meaningmaking, all works of art however mundane have value, all things are worth studying, infinite lores to embed yourself in.

"But isnt that in itself fun? That this aesthetic executive function (to *choose* the degree to which you sense things) is the barrier between us and pure input?" (pg 5)
"the degree to which others are able to limit themselves unknowingly in order ot accommodate their realities has mean to me that i have the liberty to negotiate mine actively, though it is a lot of work" (pg 6)

correctly identifying the agency to *choose* how exactly it is that you interface with stimuli in the external world, i.e. tailoring your world-sense. Inner world building, to live becomes to play.
