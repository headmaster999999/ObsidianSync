# notes

the poems are valued based on their adherance to the content of the original poem: 

> 鹿 柴
> 
> 空 山 不 見 人,
> 但 聞 人 語 響.
> 返 景 入 深 林,
> 復 照 青 苔 上
> 
>  王维

he chastises poets for adding and subtracting from the source material, argues that artistic licence separates the english perception of the work from the intention, rewards thoughtfulness (Octavio paz). he writer that duty of the poet is humilty, stand at the foot of a poem that dictates itself. theres less interest in a critial reading of translation *al la* Benjamin, who straightens out the nature of all language as essentially haphazard and inadaquate, in necessary need of license to get half of anything across, and moreso makes translation a preocuppation of upheld intentions. he praises Pound for the beauty of his poems in *Cathay*, but not for their loyalty to the originals.

there is an arbitrary reward for *poetism* itself in the book, which i couldnt parse. some are considered better than others as a matter of taste, which i was hardly able to share. besides on specfically gorgeous poem towards the end:

> Empty mountains:
> no one to be seen.
> Yet — hear —
> human sounds and echoes.
> Returning sunlight
> enters the dark woods;
> Again shining
> on the green moss, above.
> 
>  — GARY SNYDER, 1978


good translations are:
- thoughtfully engaged with the intentions of the poem, taking into account cultural and religious considerations of the poet,
- neither adds nor removes implications

characteristics of good translations of chinese poems:
- observes parallelism as practiced in couplets of tang poems.
- considers the indirect, "white space" of the chinese language/poems.


my attempt at a translation:

> empty mountain, no one to be seen
> but the voice of man echos.
> light, returning, enters deep into the forest
> illuminating the green lichen, again.
