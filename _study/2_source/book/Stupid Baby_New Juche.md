# notes

she is like river and he is like me. and yes we are both sex addicted.

she is kind and earnest and loving. an angel whose sms messages of devotion and good will head each short section like amulets hung over an oft exited door. she loves him, its clear. they had a wonderful life together (this is an invested assumption).

the writer is listless and lazy and fucks all day, maybe this is just a condition of a libertine colonialist? he is a sex addict and solicits the bodies of women in colonized countries (this time Thailand, a classic destination for these types). he does basically zero writing, the book itself is quite short (no more than a 60 page chapbook.) are all writers as indolent? is there little ambition? a writer who fucks off to Thailand for the low cost of living and a cookie for being a white boy and to fuck. perhaps a fulfilled life, in a pervert bohemian sort of way, but nonetheless pathetic to all of us. (this is another invested opinion). 


despite the dysfunction between them, her being a sex worker who was thrust into the field after having been imprisoned and habitually raped by a local politician over a period of time, him being a sex addicted colonialist, there is love. the love she feels for him is tangible. its expression pacifying. the impetus for the book is this love she expresses which he refuses to reciprocate. his only act of physical tenderness towards her being when he sucks on her nipples after getting drunk enough to see her at all. one other act of tenderness in the book, but one only symbolic: he visits a Buddhist priest to be cured of a curse Goong fears has been cast on him--the suspicious phenomenon being his involvement with another woman. nothing else. 

again, shes an angel. 

another resemblance: he is an anthropologist by training.

he appears to be castrated by porn and sex addiction. much to think about. how pathetic. the sense to love is dulled. perhaps he loves her, truly, maybe he is embarrassed to express it as unapologetic-ally.



perhaps it is a common experience to meet and leave the cherished company of anther person, but the weighty affect of the episode in each instance has it feel universally singular.
